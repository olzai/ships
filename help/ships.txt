                              The Ships Game
                              ==============

This is a documentation of the Ships game, which is based on the package of
`Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection'. Find the hidden ships.

appendix A for the licence text in full. This game was developed
using the package of `Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection'
(www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles). This software is _not_ part
of the `Collection'.

Chapter 1: How to compile the code
----------------------------------

       The code is written in _C_. Because it is based on the package of
       `Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection', it must be compiled
       as if it were a part of the package. Specifically, in Linux do the
       following:

        1. Copy the file ships.c to the source directory of the
           `Collection'.

        2. Add the game specification to the CMakeLists.txt file:

             puzzle(ships
               DISPLAYNAME "Ships"
               DESCRIPTION "Ship-finding puzzle"
               OBJECTIVE "Find the hidden ships."
             )

        3. Execute the commands:

             cmake -S <source_directory>
             cmake --build <build_directory>

       To run the game, execute the file `ships' in the <build_directory>.

Chapter 2: How to play
----------------------

       The aim of the game is to determine the positions of ships in a
       grid, given the sum totals of ship cells per row or column. A ship
       is a sequence of grid cells in the horizontal or vertical direction.
       The ships cannot touch each other horizontally, vertically or
       diagonally.

       The sum totals of rows and columns are specified on the left of and
       above the grid, respectively. The lengths of the ships to find are
       listed below the grid, in the line beginning with the word `ships'.
       There are as many ships as the lengths specified.

       The end cells of a ship are marked by _triangles_ that point along
       the ship axis in the directions away from the inner cells. The inner
       cells are marked by _squares_. In the special case of a one-cell
       ship, the cell is marked by a _rhombus_. A cell not occupied by a
       ship can be marked by a _dot_, but this is not required to solve the
       puzzle. To indicate that a cell is occupied by a ship, it can be
       temporarily filled with a _white background_; to solve the puzzle,
       the cell must be eventually marked with a triangle, a square or a
       rhombus.

   2.1 Ships controls

       In order to mark a cell, to change the mark or to remove it, you can
       place a cursor there with a mouse click and then left-click one of
       the nine squares below the grid. As explained above, the marks have
       the following meaning (from left to right):

        -  remove the mark (empty cell);

        -  cell not occupied (dot);

        -  cell occupied (filled background);

        -  upper end of a vertically oriented ship (triangle pointed
           upwards);

        -  right end of a horizontally oriented ship (triangle pointed
           rightwards);

        -  lower end of a vertically oriented ship (triangle pointed
           downwards);

        -  left end of a horizontally oriented ship (triangle pointed
           leftwards);

        -  one-cell ship (rhombus);

        -  inner cell of a ship (square).

       Alternatively, the marks of a cell can be switched by consecutively
       pressing _Enter_ or _right_-clicking the mouse. The cursor can be
       moved around the grid by using the _arrow keys_.

       Some cells are marked at the time of generating the puzzle. They
       can be distinguished by a thicker border. The marks of these
       cells cannot be changed, with the exception of cells with filled
       background (and blue border), where a triangle, a square or a
       rhombus are to be placed during the game.

       The sum totals for rows and columns can be left-clicked to mark
       them done (grey them out) or unmark them again. Completed ships are
       greyed out automatically (which does not necessarily mean, however,
       that their positions are correct).

       (All the actions described in section 2.1 of the documentation of
       `Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection' are also available.)

   2.2 Ships parameters

       These parameters are available from the `Custom...' option on the
       `Type' menu.

       _Height_, _Width_

           Size of grid in squares.

       _Difficulty_

           Controls the difficulty of the generated puzzle. At the Basic
           and Intermediate levels the one-cell ships are avoided (they
           are more difficult to find). At the Advanced and Extreme levels
           some of the sum totals for rows and columns may be hidden. The
           Extreme and, possibly, Advanced levels may require backtracking.
