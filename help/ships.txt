                              The Ships Game
                              ==============

This is a documentation of the Ships game, which is based on the package of
`Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection'. Find the hidden ships.

appendix A for the licence text in full. This game was developed
using the package of `Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection'
(www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles). This software is _not_ part
of the `Collection'.

Chapter 1: How to compile the code
----------------------------------

       The code is written in _C_. Because it is based on the package of
       `Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection', it must be compiled
       as if it were a part of the package. Specifically, in Linux do the
       following:

        1. Copy the file ships.c to the source directory of the
           `Collection'.

        2. Add the game specification to the CMakeLists.txt file:

             puzzle(ships
               DISPLAYNAME "Ships"
               DESCRIPTION "Ship-finding puzzle"
               OBJECTIVE "Find the hidden ships."
             )

        3. Execute the commands:

             cmake -S <source_directory>
             cmake --build <build_directory>

       To run the game, execute the file `ships' in the <build_directory>.

Chapter 2: How to play
----------------------

       The aim of the game is to determine the positions of ships in a
       grid, given the sum totals of ship cells per row or column. A ship
       is a sequence of grid cells in the horizontal or vertical direction.
       The ships cannot touch each other horizontally, vertically or
       diagonally.

       The sum totals of rows and columns are specified on the left of and
       above the grid, respectively. The lengths of the ships to find are
       listed below the grid, in the line beginning with the word `ships'.
       There are as many ships as the lengths specified.

       The end cells of a ship are marked by _triangles_ that point along
       the ship axis in the directions away from the inner cells. The inner
       cells are marked by _squares_. In the special case of a one-cell
       ship, the cell is marked by a _rhombus_. To indicate that a cell
       is occupied by a ship, it can be temporarily filled with a _white
       background_; to solve the puzzle, the cell must be eventually marked
       with a triangle, a square or a rhombus. A cell not occupied by a
       ship can be marked by a _dot_, but this is not required to solve
       the puzzle (except in the case where dots are used to indicate the
       limits of a ship, see section 2.1).

   2.1 Ships controls

       An unfilled cell can be marked occupied by _left_-clicking it. Left-
       clicking a filled cell removes the mark. The _right_ click labels an
       unfilled cell with a dot indicating that the cell is not occupied,
       or removes an existing dot. Multiple cells in a row or a column can
       be marked with dots or cleared from dots by a right _drag_.

       Alternatively, the cell mark can be switched between `occupied',
       `not occupied' and `unfilled' by consecutively pressing _Enter_. The
       cursor can be moved around the grid by using the _arrow keys_.

       The game takes care of labeling the occupied cells with a specific
       symbol (triangle, square, rhombus) automatically. The player,
       however, must tell the game where the ship ends by placing a dot in
       the cell next the end cell of the ship along the ship axis (unless
       the ship ends at the border). A one-cell ship is marked by placing
       dots next to its all four sides.

       Some cells are marked at the time of generating the puzzle. They
       can be distinguished by a thicker border. The marks of these cells
       cannot be changed, with the exception of white filled cells without
       a symbol, where the symbols are to be determined during the game.

       The sum totals for rows and columns can be left-clicked to mark
       them done (grey them out) or unmark them again. Completed ships are
       greyed out automatically (which does not necessarily mean, however,
       that their positions are correct).

       (All the actions described in section 2.1 of the documentation of
       `Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection' are also available.)

   2.2 Ships parameters

       These parameters are available from the `Custom...' option on the
       `Type' menu.

       _Height_, _Width_

           Size of grid in squares.

       _Difficulty_

           Controls the difficulty of the generated puzzle. At the Basic
           and Intermediate levels the one-cell ships are avoided (they are
           more difficult to find). At the Advanced and Unreasonable levels
           some of the sum totals for rows and columns may be hidden. The
           Unreasonable level may require backtracking.
