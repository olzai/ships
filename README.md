The game Ships is based on the package of 'Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle
Collection' (`www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles`). This software is _not_ part
of the 'Collection'. 

The aim of the game is to determine the positions of ships in a 
grid, given the sum totals of ship cells per row or column.
